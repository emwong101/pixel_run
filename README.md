## Description
Pixel Run is my capstone submission for the Brainstation Web Development program. I decided to explore game development as a personal challenge and to further develop my understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript. Growing up, I spent many hours on sites such as Newgrounds playing browser games, which inspired the base idea for Pixel Run.
The game is fully responsive, and supports touch controls. This project hosts the game within a React Native Application and contains details regarding the techstack used and a short description. To access the game separately, you can found the beta version hosted [here](https://emilywongg.itch.io/pixel-run), or access the codebase for the game [here](https://github.com/emwong101/pixel_run_game).
